Description: application launcher to start apps in a restrictive sandbox
 sandbox-app-launcher runs each app as its own user, in a bubblewrap sandbox
 and confined by apparmor.
 .
 The directory, `/shared`, is shared across all app sandboxes to transfer
 files across.
 .
 This implements a permissions system to configure what apps can access.
 There are currently 5 available permissions:
 .
  * Network access
 .
  * Webcam access
 .
  * Microphone access
 .
  * Shared storage access (read-only or read-write)
 .
  * Dynamic native code execution
 .
 All apps the user installs will be automatically configured to run in
 the sandbox and a prompt will ask the user which permissions they wish to
 grant the application (not implemented yet).
 .
 Currently a WIP and not for actual use.
